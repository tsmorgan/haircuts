A web app to track when I last had a hair cut.

I wanted a quick way to create a app-like thing on my phone that I could open and hit a button and track the date of when I last had a hair cut. Then I could open it and it would show me the length of time in weeks since my last one.

I added a table that displays all the previous dates and allows you to delete them, and a date input so if I forget to open the app till the following day I can still add the correct date in.
